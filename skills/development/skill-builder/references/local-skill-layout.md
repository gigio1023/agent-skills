# Repository Sources And Installed Copies

## Source Of Truth

Edit the selected checkout under skills/<category>/<skill-name>. Reuse existing categories and conventions, read project instructions, and preserve unrelated changes. This repository uses development/ and productivity/.

Update catalogs when adding, removing, renaming, or changing advertised scope. Do not rewrite unrelated catalog entries to standardize wording.

## Development And Installation

Resolve installed paths and symlink targets before editing:

- A plain global directory is a deployed copy. Edit repository sources and report that the installed version remains unchanged.
- A development symlink may make repository edits live immediately; respect that scope and do not silently repoint it.
- Per-skill links and shared-directory links are both valid. Preserve topology; do not replace an entire agent skill directory to expose one change.

Use install-skill-pack for requested remote-pack installations. Source editing does not itself authorize replacing global packages.

## Local-Only Migration

When migration is requested, copy the entire local package to its intended source, compare files, and preserve user data. Repoint the installed copy only within the migration's scope. Do not overwrite local-only work because names match.

## Verification

Check name/folder identity, trigger clarity, resource paths, and documented commands. Report source branch/path and whether an installed copy changed. Size and section-style advisories are not migration blockers.
