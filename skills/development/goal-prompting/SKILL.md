# Goal Prompting

Turn intent into a goal prompt that the named harness can pursue and judge
honestly. Support advice, drafting, review, cross-harness translation, and
explicit activation without forcing one workflow on every request.

## Quick Path

1. Identify the requested mode: explain, draft, review, translate, or activate.
   Do not turn a request for guidance or copy into a running goal.
2. Identify the target harness. Read
   [references/codex-goals.md](references/codex-goals.md) for Codex and
   [references/claude-goals.md](references/claude-goals.md) for Claude Code.
   When translating, read both.
3. Inspect safely available context before asking for facts: repository
   instructions, plans, tests, scripts, issues, logs, or the supplied draft.
   Ask one concise question only when the missing answer changes the outcome or
   completion evidence materially.
4. Decide whether goal mode fits. Use it for substantial work with a closed,
   verifiable end state. Recommend a normal prompt, plan, automation, or human
   review gate when that is the better control surface.
5. Write the smallest contract that preserves the outcome, evidence, material
   boundaries, and real stop conditions. Keep a direct goal payload below the
   target's documented limit. For domain-specific proof or a file-backed
   contract, read [references/goal-patterns.md](references/goal-patterns.md).
6. Audit the draft for false completion, unverified assumptions, impossible
   checks, hidden side effects, and target-specific evaluator blind spots.
7. Return the requested artifact. Activate it only when the user explicitly
   asked to set or start the goal and the current session exposes an
   agent-callable goal-state capability.

For the dated official sources and reviewed community patterns behind these
rules, read [references/source-notes.md](references/source-notes.md).

## Goal Fit

A goal fits substantial multi-turn work with a closed, observable finish line:
a bounded migration, failing-to-passing bug fix, benchmark target, finite
review queue, or decision-ready research artifact.

Use another surface when:

- one direct turn or a small edit is enough;
- the route must be approved before changes begin, which calls for a plan;
- work repeats on a schedule or reacts indefinitely, which calls for an
  automation or hook;
- no rubric, reference, or human gate can make subjective completion honest;
- unrelated backlog items have no single terminal outcome.

Goal mode governs continuation. It does not expand permissions, authorize
external or destructive actions, replace project instructions, or turn missing
access into permission.

## Shared Goal Contract

Use only the parts that change the run. Do not force these into fixed headings
when one compact paragraph is clearer.

- **Outcome:** one concrete state, artifact, behavior, or decision that will be
  true at completion.
- **Context:** the files, sources, reproduction, plan, issue, or environment
  that materially changes the work or should be inspected first.
- **Verification:** the check and expected signal that prove completion. Name
  exact commands only after confirming they exist or deriving them from the
  project. Require the agent to report the evidence it actually observed.
- **Constraints:** compatibility, preservation, safety, authority, quality, and
  side-effect limits that prevent a plausible wrong result.
- **Scope:** include or exclude paths, systems, records, or deliverables only
  when ambiguity would widen the task.
- **Stop or escalation:** name missing access, failed prerequisites, conflicts,
  unsafe operations, or user decisions that should stop continuation. Add a
  time, turn, or cost bound only when the user wants one or runaway risk makes
  a proposed bound worth confirming.

## Modes

### Explain

Answer the user's question and make the target-specific behavior explicit. If
both harnesses matter, compare only differences that change how the goal should
be written or operated.

### Draft

Return a ready-to-use goal payload for the named target plus assumptions or a
short rationale only when useful. A user asking for copy has not asked to start
the goal.

### Review

Lead with the highest-impact defects, then provide a revised payload or minimal
patch. Preserve working constraints and user intent. Check target syntax,
payload length, evidence visibility, scope, authority, and completion honesty.

### Translate

Preserve the outcome and evidence while adapting evaluator semantics:

- Codex to Claude Code: make every completion claim demonstrable in the
  conversation because Claude Code's goal evaluator does not inspect tools or
  files itself. Add an optional run bound only when wanted.
- Claude Code to Codex: retain transcript-friendly evidence, then express the
  objective as outcome, constraints, and verification. Keep runtime budget
  controls separate unless the user explicitly requested them.

Translation is not literal rewriting. Remove source-harness commands, status
verbs, metadata, or assumptions that the target does not share.

### Activate

Activation changes the current session's goal state and may immediately start
work. Do it only on an explicit set, start, create, or run request and only
through an agent-callable goal-state capability in that same session. Claude
Code's `/goal` is user-entered session input, so return a ready-to-submit command
and say that the user must submit it. Do not start another CLI process or remote
session to simulate activation.

1. Inspect the current goal state when the harness supports it.
2. Continue a matching active goal instead of creating a duplicate.
3. If an unfinished goal conflicts, explain the conflict and request a choice
   rather than replacing it silently.
4. Set the refined objective through the target's native capability. Include a
   token budget only when the user explicitly supplied one.
5. Follow the runtime's own rules for completion, blocking, pause, resume, and
   clearing. Never claim completion without the evidence named in the goal.

If the current session cannot expose an agent-callable goal capability, return
the copy-paste payload and a minimal handoff instruction.

## Output Contract

Match the response to the request:

- explanation: recommendation, target-specific reason, and a small example when
  it clarifies the rule;
- draft: one copy-paste payload, then material assumptions or caveats;
- review: findings first, followed by the corrected payload;
- translation: target payload plus the semantic changes that mattered;
- direct activation: the goal state changed, the objective used, and any
  immediate caveat or next action;
- activation handoff: the ready-to-submit command and the fact that the user
  must submit it in the target session.

When returning direct command text, count characters if it is near the target's
limit. Do not say a goal was activated when only text was produced.

## Gotchas

- A goal prompt is both direction and exit criteria. A detailed activity list
  with no terminal state can keep work busy without making completion honest.
- A referenced file is not automatically visible to a separate evaluator.
- “Work autonomously and never ask” can suppress necessary approval or blocker
  handling. Define the decisions the agent may make and the conditions that
  require escalation.
- Mandatory budgets, universal test bans, fixed check counts, and exhaustive
  templates create fake rigor when the task does not need them.
- Do not invent project commands, available tools, deployment targets, audience
  stakes, or production access to make a prompt look complete.
- General model prompting belongs in the model-specific prompting guides. This
  skill owns goal-mode contracts and handoffs.
